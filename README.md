# CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition 
Working through the assignments of Stanford's CS231n to improve my knowledge of computer vision
and deep learning, particularly backpropagation and writing efficient vectorised code.
* Assigment 1: 
    * k-Nearest Neighbours (vectorised numpy, hyperparameter tuning, visualisations)
    * Linear SVM (loss, gradient, tuning, stochastic gradient descent, visualisations)
    * Softmax classifier (loss, gradient, tuning, stochastic gradient descent, visualisations)
    * Two-layer neural network (forward and backward pass, training, visualisations, tuning)
    * Feature extraction (HoG, colour histogram)

Implemented in Python 3.
